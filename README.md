# Jumping Survival Game

## Introduction:
We propose developing a single player version of a minigame inspired by Fall Guys. The goal of the game is to survive the longest without falling off the spinning disk. As the game progresses, parts of the disk will start falling off, restricting the player's movement area. Additionally, the speed of the spinning fireball will increase, creating more challenges for the player. The game will feature a rolling ball as the player avatar, and the camera will provide a third-person perspective.

## Gameplay:
The player's objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding falling off the platform or colliding with the spinning fireball. The longer the player survives, the higher their score. The score will be calculated based on the number of seconds survived in each round.

## Controls:
The player will control the rolling ball using the following controls:

W: Move forward
A: Move left
D: Move right
S: Move backward

In addition to movement controls, we will implement other necessary keys for game interface control, such as:

Enter: Continue or select an option
P: Pause the game

## Technical Features:
Collision Detection: We will implement collision detection to detect when the player collides with the spinning fireball or when the player falls off the platform. This will trigger the loss of a life and appropriate game responses.

## Lighting Effects:
To enhance the gameplay experience, we will implement dynamic lighting effects. This will include simulating the light source solely from the fireballs during specific intervals when the other light sources are turned off. It will create a visually immersive environment.

## Textures and Visual Detail: 
We will incorporate textures to provide visual cues for the player's ball movement and to add overall visual detail to the game. This will involve designing and applying textures to the platform, fireball, and other relevant game elements.

## Additional Considerations:
User Interface: We will design a user-friendly interface that includes elements such as a timer to display the player's survival time, score display, and relevant game information.

## Conclusion:
Our game aims to capture the essence of the Fall Guys minigame while offering an enjoyable single player experience. By implementing collision detection, lighting effects, textures, and visual detail, we strive to create an engaging and visually immersive game. The proposed gameplay mechanics and technical features will provide an exciting challenge for players to survive as long as possible and achieve high scores.
